## 11/2/2025 10 AM - Started designing the pcb  

I decided the layout of the keyboard using Keyboard Layout editor its going to be a 75% (the best %). and started making the schematic and laying out the pcb.

## 11/2/2025 2 PM - Routed the pcb and added design  

Today I routed all the traces of the pcb, cut out the edges, figured out how to do the firmware with qmk and or via, and added the silkscreen image to the front.![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--84e2063024910cf0b2883776e3b4558b6f130e74/image.png)
  

## 11/2/2025 6 PM - rerouted everything, and started on the case and renders  

I realized all of the switches were flipped, so i had to flip all of them and reroute the entire pcb. After that I designed a case in fusion and exported it to blender and made some renders.

Today I made the docs, the bom, finalized the case and also finalized the pcb. This is the hardest part of the project to keep motivation through but atleast im done!  

## 11/4/2025 - I updated the bom and edited the pcb

This past few days I updated the bom because for some reason one of my cables cost 10 dollars, and I was told the schematic was unreadable (it was) so I started to use net labels.
